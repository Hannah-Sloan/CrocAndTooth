A new card, Crocadile. Along with a custom sigil, Toothy.

- Crocadile: A +1 +2 Reptile Card with a cost of 1 and the Toothy Sigil. The gimmick is the crocadile has so many teeth, they fall out as it takes damage.
- Toothy: When this creature takes damage, it will award teeth equal to the damage taken.
